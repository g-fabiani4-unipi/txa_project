We developed a classifier that can be configured to use Bidirectional Long Short Term Memories and linear Support Vector Machines as learning algorithms. When using Bi-{LSTMs} we tested a multitask learning approach which learns the optimized parameters of the network exploiting simultaneously all the annotated dataset labels and a multiclassiﬁer voting approach based on a k-fold technique. In addition, we developed generic and specific word embedding lexicons to further improve classiﬁcation performances. When evaluated on the official test sets, our system ranked 1st in almost all subtasks for each shared task, showing the effectiveness of our approach.},

In this review, we systematically analyze the resources made available by the community at large, including their development methodology, topical focus, language coverage, and other factors. The results of our analysis highlight a heterogeneous, growing landscape, marked by several issues and venues for improvement.},

	abstract = {The exponential growth of social media has brought an increasing propagation of online hostile communication and vitriolic discourses, and social media have become a fertile ground for heated discussions that frequently result in the use of insulting and offensive language. Lexical resources containing specific negative words have been widely employed to detect uncivil communication. This paper describes the development and implementation of an innovative resource, namely the Revised {HurtLex} Lexicon, in which every headword is annotated with an offensiveness level score. The starting point is {HurtLex}, a multilingual lexicon of hate words. Concentrating on the Italian entries, we revised the terms in {HurtLex} and derived an offensive score for each lexical item by applying an Item Response Theory model to the ratings provided by a large number of annotators. This resource can be used as part of a lexicon-based approach to track offensive and hateful content. Our work comprises an evaluation of the Revised {HurtLex} lexicon.},

	abstract = {The paper proposes an investigation on the role of populist themes and rhetoric in an Italian Twitter corpus of hate speech against immigrants. The corpus has been annotated with four new layers of analysis: Nominal Utterances, that can be seen as consistent with populist rhetoric; In-out-group rhetoric, a very common populist strategy to polarize public opinion; Slogan-like nominal utterances, that may convey the call for severe illiberal policies against immigrants; News, to recognize the role of newspapers (headlines or reference to articles) in the Twitter political discourse on immigration featured by hate speech. The results show that populist themes compose 1/3 of the hate speech, displaying not only {InOut}-group rhetoric, but also authoritarianism, mostly carried by Slogan-like nominal utterances. It also appears that news don’t convey much hate speech, while they compose almost half of the non hateful tweets.},
